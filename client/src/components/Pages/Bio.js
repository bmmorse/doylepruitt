            In 2001 I earned a Bachelor of Science degree in both Psychology and
            Social Work from Nazareth College. I graduated from Syracuse
            University in 2002 with an MSW degree. In 2012, I successfully
            passed New York Stateâ€™s licensing exams and met the criteria needed
            to earn the LCSW-R. In 2013, I earned a PhD from the University at
            Buffalo.

            My work with trauma survivors is grounded in Attachment Theory. In
            this perspective, the therapist-client relationship is understood to
            be a fundamental aspect of treatment. As each individual responds
            differently to trauma, the particular approach and methods used must
            be carefully chosen to fit their unique needs. I integrate a number
            of modalities: sensorimotor psychotherapy, EMDR, TF-CBT,
            psychodynamic psychotherapy, and play.

            My goal with the client is to first establish safety and
            stabilization. Once this is achieved we can move towards exploring
            and understanding their trauma. This does NOT mean clients must
            recall, in detail, what has happened to them. Resolving trauma can
            be achieved by recognizing and reducing the power of triggers,
            understanding symptoms in the context they developed, taking control
            of emotions, and developing mindfulness. This mind-body approach
            enables the client to develop more adaptive functioning, change
            their belief system, and take control over their life.
