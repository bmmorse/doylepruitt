        <p>
          In 2001 I earned a Bachelor of Science degree in both Psychology and
          Social Work from Nazareth College. I graduated from Syracuse
          University in 2002 with an MSW degree. In 2012, I successfully passed
          New York Stateâ€™s licensing exams and met the criteria needed to earn
          the coveted LCSW-R. In 2013, I earned a PhD from the University at
          Buffalo.
