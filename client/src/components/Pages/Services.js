        <p>
          I have extensive experience working with individuals and families
          coping with trauma, adversity, disturbance, and the stressors of daily
          life. This can be the result of the stressor as an isolated event such
          as a break-up, failure, accident, death, etc. or an ongoing experience
          like family discord, mental illness, interpersonal abuse or neglect,
          oppression, or discrimination.
        </p>
        <p>
          My clinical practice has included work with individuals coping with:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Trauma</li>
          <li>Adverse life experiences</li>
          <li>Grief and loss</li>
          <li>Anxiety</li>
          <li>Depression</li>
          <li>Academic struggles (e.g. performance, relationships, stress)</li>
          <li>Performance anxiety</li>
          <li>
            Family transitions (e.g. endings, blendings, transitions, additions
            and loss, changes in roles)
          </li>
          <li>Disruptive behaviors</li>
          <li>Relationship discord</li>
          <li>LGBTQ+</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          My approach is client-centered and humanistic. My experience has shown
          that when we identify and resolve the underlying cause of the
          “problem”, not only does current functioning and well-being improve,
          but the change lasts longer. I believe clients are the expert of their
          own life. My role is to partner with you in discovering the answers
          that help you heal and improve your life.
        </p>

        <p>I have helped clients:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Heal from traumatic experiences</li>
          <li>Change destructive behaviors into healthy, helpful behaviors</li>
          <li>Navigate transitions in life and normal development</li>
          <li>Develop or enhance coping skills</li>
          <li>
            Establish and enforce boundaries in their personal and professional
            relationships
          </li>
          <li>Improve communication skills</li>
          <li>Develop more effective parenting practices</li>
          <li>
            Foster deeper, more meaningful relationships (and let go of
            destructive ones)
          </li>
          <li>Recognize their inner strength, potential, and worth</li>
          <li>Discover their true self</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          All behavior serves a purpose. Only when we understand what that
          purpose is can we work towards accepting, modifying, or extinguishing
          the behavior. This often requires the circumstances or individuals
          contributing to the development of the behavior to also change. That
          is why family participation in treatment (especially with children and
          adolescents) is critical.
