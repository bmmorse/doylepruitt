    <p>
      In 2001 I earned a Bachelor of Science degree in both Psychology and
      Social Work from Nazareth College. I graduated from Syracuse University in
      2002 with an MSW degree. In 2012, I successfully passed New York State’s
      licensing exams and met the criteria needed to earn the LCSW-R. In 2013, I
      earned a PhD from the University at Buffalo.

      My work with trauma survivors is grounded in Attachment Theory. In this
      perspective, the therapist-client relationship is understood to be a
      fundamental aspect of treatment. As each individual responds differently
      to trauma, the particular approach and methods used must be carefully
      chosen to fit their unique needs. I integrate a number of modalities:
      sensorimotor psychotherapy, EMDR, TF-CBT, psychodynamic psychotherapy, and
      play.
    </p>

      My goal with the client is to first establish safety and stabilization.
      Once this is achieved we can move towards exploring and understanding
      their trauma. This does NOT mean clients must recall, in detail, what has
      happened to them. Resolving trauma can be achieved by recognizing and
      reducing the power of triggers, understanding symptoms in the context they
      developed, taking control of emotions, and developing mindfulness. This
      mind-body approach enables the client to develop more adaptive
      functioning, change their belief system, and take control over their life.

      I have extensive experience working with individuals and families coping
      with trauma, adversity, disturbance, and the stressors of daily life. This
      can be the result of the stressor as an isolated event such as a break-up,
      failure, accident, death, etc. or an ongoing experience like family
      discord, mental illness, interpersonal abuse or neglect, oppression, or
      discrimination.
    </p>
    <p>My clinical practice has included work with individuals coping with:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Trauma</li>
      <li>Adverse life experiences</li>
      <li>Grief and loss</li>
      <li>Anxiety</li>
      <li>Depression</li>
      <li>Academic struggles (e.g. performance, relationships, stress)</li>
      <li>Performance anxiety</li>
      <li>
        Family transitions (e.g. endings, blendings, transitions, additions and
        loss, changes in roles)
      </li>
      <li>Disruptive behaviors</li>
      <li>Relationship discord</li>
      <li>LGBTQ+</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      My approach is client-centered and humanistic. My experience has shown
      that when we identify and resolve the underlying cause of the “problem”,
      not only does current functioning and well-being improve, but the change
      lasts longer. I believe clients are the expert of their own life. My role
      is to partner with you in discovering the answers that help you heal and
      improve your life.
    </p>
    <p>I have helped clients:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Heal from traumatic experiences</li>
      <li>Change destructive behaviors into healthy, helpful behaviors</li>
      <li>Navigate transitions in life and normal development</li>
      <li>Develop or enhance coping skills</li>
      <li>
        Establish and enforce boundaries in their personal and professional
        relationships
      </li>
      <li>Improve communication skills</li>
      <li>Develop more effective parenting practices</li>
      <li>
        Foster deeper, more meaningful relationships (and let go of destructive
        ones)
      </li>
      <li>Recognize their inner strength, potential, and worth</li>
      <li>Discover their true self</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      All behavior serves a purpose. Only when we understand what that purpose
      is can we work towards accepting, modifying, or extinguishing the
      behavior. This often requires the circumstances or individuals
      contributing to the development of the behavior to also change. That is
      why family participation in treatment (especially with children and
      adolescents) is critical.
