React + Express App, built with styled components.

## Overview

This is a static site and did not require a backend API. Therefore, `index.js` is effectively boilerplate to start Express and serve React's index.html.

## App.js

First, we import <Globals />, a react component that imports fonts and global CSS via `createGlobalStyle`. Second, we import <Routes />, which organizes React Router routes.
